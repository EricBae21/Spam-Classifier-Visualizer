# Spam-Classifier-Visualizer
Binary Tree Classifier

This visualizer is completely in java and uses the JGraphT library and JGraphX for visualization

Edit: In order for an easy download and use of the files in this Visualizer, the source code from jgrapht-1.5.2 was added directly in the same parent folder (folders lib and org). Some files have been deleted for the sake of space and necessity (sorry devs of JGraph). 

# Key Information

The only two main files are `TreeVisualizer.java` which has been added and `Client.java` has been
modified. The `lib` folder has all the necessary `.jar` files, the `com` folder holds the necessary
`JGraphX` files, and the `org` folder has all the `JGraphT` files.
